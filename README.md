# svelte-three-shaders

> A Svelte.js project

Just an experiment with svelte.js, three.js and shaders. This is my first time using svelte.js.

View the build [HERE](https://2pha.github.io/svelte-three-shaders/public/)

Recreation in svelte of the vue.js version [HERE](https://github.com/2pha/vue-three-shaders)
React version [HERE](https://github.com/2pha/react-three-shaders)

It implements some of the shaders from [this blog post](https://2pha.com/blog/experimenting-threejs-shaders-and-shadermaterial/) in a vue app.
